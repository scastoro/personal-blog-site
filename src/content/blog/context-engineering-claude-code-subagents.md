Cool — I dug into the official docs and community write-ups, and can reframe the blog draft to focus specifically on Claude Code subagents / custom agents and how context engineering plays out in that ecosystem. I'll stick close to what's documented (or reliably reported) and only add minimal extra framing so it's still narrative.

# Context Engineering in Claude Code: Custom Subagents as Specialized Helpers

In Claude Code, the shift from prompt engineering toward context engineering + agent delegation becomes particularly meaningful via custom subagents. These subagents let you isolate responsibilities, reduce context pollution, and tailor tool access for each domain. This post zooms into how that works in the Claude Code world.

---

## A Very Brief Primer: Prompt → Context → Agents

I'll skim this: early work with LLMs centered on prompt engineering — trying different phrasings, few-shot examples, etc. But as soon as you hit real scale (multi-file repos, multiple concerns), prompt tweaks alone break down.

Enter context engineering: you start thinking about which information lives in the model's working memory, how it's retrieved, how system prompts are set, and how tools are exposed. In Claude Code, that manifests in `CLAUDE.md`, agent manifests, and subagent context windows.

Then, to scale beyond one monolithic assistant, you use custom subagents, each with its own context, system prompts, and tool permissions, that Claude delegates to when tasks match.

---

## What Are Claude Code Subagents?

According to the Claude Code docs, subagents are pre-configured AI personalities with:

* Their own context window, separate from the main conversation.
* A custom system prompt that defines their role, constraints, style, and domain.
* A bounded tool set (you can restrict what tools the subagent can use).

Because they run in isolated contexts, they help prevent context pollution — for example you don't want your React logic discussion bleeding into your database migration agent's reasoning.

You can both explicitly invoke a subagent (for example "Use the code-reviewer subagent on this diff") or allow Claude Code to automatically delegate tasks if they match a subagent's triggers.

Subagent definitions live as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Key fields include:

```yaml
---
name: my-subagent
description: "Handles database schema refactoring"
tools: migrate, schema-inspect  # optional—if omitted, inherits all tools
model: inherit  # or explicitly "sonnet", "haiku", etc.
---

# System prompt for the subagent
You are the "db-refactor" agent. Your job is to produce safe schema migrations,
ensure backward compatibility, generate rollback scripts, validate constraints, etc.
```

When there are conflicts (for example same subagent name defined at user versus project level), project-level definitions take precedence.

## Why Subagents Help: The Context Engineering Benefits

### 1. Context Isolation

Each subagent has its own sandbox — its own memory or working context. That means your primary Claude thread stays focused on high-level orchestration, while domain-specific reasoning lives elsewhere.

### 2. Focused, Specialized Behavior

Because each subagent carries a role-specific system prompt and narrowed tool access, it behaves more predictably in its domain. For instance, a linting subagent doesn't need the full universe of tools — it just needs code analysis, formatting, lint, and related utilities.

### 3. Tool and Permission Control

You can restrict which tools a subagent is allowed to use (read-only versus write, etc.). That gives you guardrails and safer delegation.

### 4. Reusability and Shared Workflows

Once you've defined subagents (in `.claude/agents/` or `~/.claude/agents/`), they become reusable across projects (or overridable per project).

### 5. Cleaner Main Context

Because the subagents deal with details, your main Claude conversation doesn't get bloated. This is critical when dealing with large codebases where token budget and context drift are real risks.

## Sample Subagent Configs and Use Cases

Here are a few illustrative examples of Claude Code subagents (drawn from docs and community).

### Code Reviewer Agent

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: "Review pull requests for code style, security, performance."
tools: lint, run_tests, static_analysis
model: inherit
---

You are the code-reviewer agent. On a diff or PR, examine changed files,
flag code smells, enforce style guidelines, run static analysis,
and suggest refactorings or fixes.
```

You might invoke it explicitly:

> Use code-reviewer on PR #42

Or let Claude auto-delegate when a diff appears.

### Debugger Agent

```yaml
---
name: debugger
description: "Analyze stack traces and logs, propose fixes."
tools: log_inspect, traceback_analyzer
model: sonnet
---

You are the debugger agent. Given error logs, stack traces, and code context,
hunt for root causes, propose patches, and explain fixes.
```

When your main Claude instance sees an exception or error output, it can pass that to the debugger agent automatically.

### Memory or Reflection Agent (Community Example)

One user built a reflection subagent that searches past Claude conversations (for example `.claude/projects`) using semantic search and surfaces relevant prior solutions to feed into the current run.

This is a way to externalize memory without bloating the live context window.

## Best Practices and Lessons for Claude Code Subagents

When working with subagents in Claude Code, here are tips derived from Anthropic's best practices and community experiences:

* Keep subagents narrowly focused — a single domain or task. Avoid overlap.
* Start with Claude-generated definitions — use `/agents` to scaffold them, then refine.
* Limit tool permissions initially — give them only what they need (read-only at first) and expand later.
* Write clear system prompts — with precise responsibilities, constraints, and stylistic expectations.
* Version control agent definitions — store the Markdown manifest files in git so they evolve with your project.
* Chain or orchestrate carefully — if subagents call each other (for example code review → refactor agent → test agent), define clear handoff protocols to avoid context conflicts.
* Consider performance and latency trade-offs — subagents can feel slower than one big agent since context switching and delegation adds overhead.

## Putting It All Together: Context plus Subagents in Practice

Here's how this might play out in a real Claude Code workflow (narrative form):

1. User starts a task (for example "Implement feature X in the backend").
2. Claude Code loads contextual files (for example `CLAUDE.md`, relevant modules) and reasons at a high level.
3. Claude identifies a need to review code, so it delegates to `code-reviewer` subagent, passing only the diff.
4. `code-reviewer` uses lint and static tools, returns annotated feedback.
5. Claude sees a test failure, delegates that portion to `debugger` subagent.
6. `debugger` inspects logs and stack traces, proposes fixes.
7. Claude integrates suggestions, asks the user if they want to apply changes, or further refine.

Throughout this, each subagent hasn't polluted the main context — only minimal summaries or results bubble up.
